# Open positions

We are always looking for highly motivated and hard-working new group members!

You will have the chance to work on important challenges in graph-based machine learning from a theoretical and practical perspective. In particular, you will work on developing new optimization models and new optimization algorithms for machine learning problems that take into account relational information among data. You will work on analyzing worst-case performance of the formulation and algorithms that are being developed and you will work on parallelizing existing and new optimization algorithms.
